# WhateverRed

An AMD iGPU support plugin for [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu).

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

This kernel extension currently contains remote debug log functionality through our custom "NetDbg" software. You must specify a valid NetDbg server IP or disable the functionality as described below.

WhateverRed NetDbg is a custom remote debug log service, which sends raw data over TCP. The first version, created in Python by [@NyanCatTW1](https://github.com/NyanCatTW1), was primitive and often unstable. The current release, developed in Rust by project lead [@ChefKissInc](https://github.com/ChefKissInc), is more stable, and has a lot more features (Like a GUI).

You can find the source code for the service [here](https://github.com/NootInc/WhateverRed-NETDBG).

To specify the NetDbg server IP and port, use the `wrednetdbgip` boot argument.

Syntax: `wrednetdbgip=<IP>:<PORT>`

Example: `wrednetdbgip=127.0.0.1:8081`

Pass `wrednetdbg=0` to disable the NetDbg functionality.

This project is under active research and development and is not yet functional, but in a close state to such.

Its goal is to bring AMD iGPU support for Renoir/Raven(2)/Renoir and their derivatives, such as Picasso.

However, due to the complexity of GPU drivers, especially those without public source code, adding support for non-existent logic is not possible. As a result, you must use Catalina (minimum) to Big Sur (recommended) since the required iGPU-related logic has been removed in Monterey and later, and only the aforementioned chip types.

Injecting kernel extensions is not possible during the OpenCore injection stage.

This is because the prelink injection fails for kernel extensions of this type, as the libraries used for them are not contained in the Boot kernel cache, which is where OpenCore injects kexts to. Instead, they're contained in the Auxiliary kernel cache.

## Introduction

We are a team of three working on getting graphics acceleration for AMD iGPUs (Raven/Raven2/Renoir and their derivatives) on hackintoshes.

We are patching the existing kexts in order to achieve this (mixing AMDRadeonX5000 for GCN 5 and AMDRadeonX6000 for VCN 1/2, and replacing AMDRadeonX6000Framebuffer for DCN instead of AMD10000Controller which is DCE).

## FAQ

### Current Progress

Controller, accelerator and framebuffer are all attached and enabled, GFX engine and SDMA0 engine start up and are able to process command buffers.

However, there is some weird quirk happening relating to GPUVM (GPU Virtual Memory), causing Page Faults in both GFX and ME as soon as WindowServer tries to send an acceleration command. This is the current failure point we are investigating will eventually fix.

### ETA?

When it is done. It may take more than a month. But we are currently stuck on 99% essentially.

## macOS Installation on laptops

It may be possible to install macOS on your laptop, but without graphics acceleration and the touchpad may not work.

### X5000 vs X6000

- X5000: GFX 9, uses VCE + UVD, and DCE 5
- X6000: GFX 10, uses VCN 2, and DCN 1/2

### Current Status

Everything starts out well and the AMD driver even congratulates us with the following message: `[3:0:0]: Controller is enabled, finish initialization`.

However, as soon as WindowServer tries to zero the video memory, VM page faults occur and cause the SDMA0 and GFX engines halt, because they fail to read the IB (buffer that contains commands for the target MicroEngine). The AMD driver will attempt to reset the GFX/SDMA0 channels every minute or so, but the page faults persist.

This results in a black screen for a few minutes, before the machine eventually restarts due to a watchdogd timeout since WindowServer fails to check in successfully.

The X6000 branch has been abandoned for awhile now.
